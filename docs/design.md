## Requirements for AI

Please build a web page for me. Here are the requirements:

1. It's a simulation application. In the context of operating system, it simulates scheduling of processes.
2. It should have a menu to select scheduling algorithms.
3. The application will update the scene by the data from api using http.
4. In the procedure of simulation, it should render each frame of the status of ready queue.

 And the last one process finished stopped to move to "finished queue". Also, the animation should indicates the path, not only fad-in/out.
