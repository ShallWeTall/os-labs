# os-labs

This project includes basic OS (operating system) algorithms and their
visualization of simulation.

## Quick start

The project is mixed with cpp, and html/css/ts code. So the build process takes
a bit longer than usual projects (But they are still acceptable).

1. `git clone --recursive https://github.com/ShelpAm/os-labs`
2. `cd os-labs`
3. `xmake`
4. `cd web`
5. `npm install`
6. `npx vite build`
7. `cd ..`

These are all the instruction to build the project.

Now, run the server-cli by `xmake run server-cli`. Or if you want to run tests
for the project: `xmake test`.
